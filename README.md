# Deep-Autoencoder-based-Clustering-of-Histopathological-Images

## Proposed Method:
Our study has been performed
on Histopathology Images ”Mitos-atypia” provided from ”Grand Challenge”
[Capron, 2014] The following steps are included in the process:
First and foremost, we began developing our model by importing our data set.
Then We pre-processed the images for the second stage. To accomplish
this, we resized the images to (96x96), which is appropriate for the architec-
ture we used. and convert to black and white using COLOR_BGR2GRAY.
The data was then divided into two groups: training and testing.
And we did experiments with three different types of autoencoders, each
with all five clustering algorithms (kmeans-hdbscan -dbscan-hierarchical-mean
shift) and finally we applied evaluation metrics (Silhouette, Davies Bouldin)
to the obtained results as figure demonstrates:
